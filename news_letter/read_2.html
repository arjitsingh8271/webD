<p>Telecom service providers started providing high-speed 5G services in the country from October 2022 onwards.</p>

<p>The government issued spectrum allocation letters to telecom service providers in August 2022, while asking them to prepare for the rollout of 5G services in the country.</p>

<p>Department of Telecom had received total bids worth Rs. 1.50 lakh crore from the 5G spectrum auction.</p>

<p>What is 5G, and how is it different from the current 3G and 4G services?</p>

<p>5G is the fifth-generation mobile network capable of transmitting a large data set at a very rapid speed.</p>

<p>In comparison to 3G and 4G, 5G has a very low latency which will enhance user experiences in various sectors. Low latency describes the efficiency to process a very high volume of data messages with a minimal delay.</p>

<p>The 5G rollout is also expected to bring more development in remote data monitoring in sectors such as mining, warehousing, telemedicine, and manufacturing, among others.</p>
